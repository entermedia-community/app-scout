<h1>Search Syntax</h1>

Here are common search terms and technique:

<h3>Multiple Words</h3>

<p>When looking for multiple words the default is to AND together each word. Searching for <b>big dog</b> is the same as <b>big AND dog</b>. </p>

<p>You can combine multiple words together with the OR statement. For example: <b>dog OR cat</b> </p>

<h3>Exact search</h3>

For example <b>"hound dog"</b> would find the only hound dogs.

<h3>Wild card searches</h3>
<p>
Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example:
</p>
<b>test*</b> or <b>te*t</b>
<p>
The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced. For example:
</p>
<b>te?t</b>
<p>
Note: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.
</p>

<h3>NOT</h3>
<p>For example <b>dog NOT hound</b> would find any dog as long as it was not a hound dog.</p>

<h3>Boosting</h3>

For unsorted searches use the caret, "^", symbol with a boost factor (a number) at the end of the term you are searching.
